# QUIZ VALLEY : WEBSITE

## DESCRIPTION

During the current pandemic (2020) new isolation rules meant that interactive entertainment took on a new look. For some, these changes were drastic, it meant that people have been unable to visit local drinking establishments and social distancing meant it became difficult to be around friends and family. 

Quiz Valley is a "pub" quiz that had operated throughout the pandemic. However, a nich√© market had opened up where families could also join in the fun and take part in a unique, live quiz show. 

Originally "pub" quizzes were for adults only, this is where Quiz Valley has honed in to encourage full family participation rather than the typical quiz team made. In fact, some questions were aimed at children only, that most adults would find difficult to answer without the help of a younger member of the team.
